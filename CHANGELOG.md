# Changelog

## v0.7.0

### Added

- `tsk guide` prints the agent workflow, and `tsk setup <claude|pi|cursor|grok|codex|opencode|--skill-dir>` installs it as a skill. `tsk --help` ends with a pointer for agents.
- The installer adds `~/.local/bin` to PATH for Bash and Zsh.

### Fixed

- At 110 columns or wider, `Tab` on the quick-add line opened a draft page that was never painted.
- A reopen request replaced by another of the same size in the same instant could be delivered as the first one.

## v0.6.0

### Added

- Native macOS and Linux binaries, a checksum-verifying install script, and a Homebrew formula.
- `tsk setup herdr` registers the installed binary with Herdr and adds `prefix+t` (board) and `prefix+a` (capture).
- CLI: `tsk status`, `tsk edit`, and `tsk steps rename|remove`.
- **NEEDS YOU** section: blocked and review tasks at the top of the board.
- Projects index with search, per-project status counts, and persistent desk · project · projects navigation.
- Quick capture (`tsk capture`) opens the task editor in a Herdr popup; the expanded quick-add takes threads and steps.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- Wide layout: at 110 columns or wider the board and task page form a four-stage slider driven by `←` / `→`.
- Archive for tasks (`ctrl+f`) and projects (from the `p` picker), with a collapsible archived group in the done drawer and read-only focus for archived projects. CLI: `tsk archive`, `tsk unarchive`, `tsk project archive|unarchive`, `tsk list --archived`.
- Trash: deleted tasks move to `trash.jsonl` once undo can no longer reach them and purge after 30 days. `tsk list --deleted` and `tsk trash restore T<n>`.

### Changed

- State files are private on Unix: `~/.tsk` is `0700` and its files `0600`; symlinked state roots are refused.
- Store format 2: a `projects` map; a v1 store migrates on load and keeps a `tsk.json.v1` backup.
- Undo history is capped at 50 entries.
- License is MIT.

## v0.4.0

- Markdown in notes (view and peek): bold, emphasis, code, fenced blocks, headings, lists, in mono modifiers only.
- Mouse text selection: drag to highlight, release to copy via OSC 52.
- Board and task-page scrollbars with click and drag; the current section header pins under the tabs.
- Modal overlays for help, palette, and project picker share one centered card.

## v0.3.0

- Threads: an optional normalized label per task, set with `--thread` on add or in plan JSON, filtered with `list --thread`.

## v0.2.0

- Steps: an ordered checklist on the task page, with `steps <task> add|toggle` on the CLI. Step progress never changes task status.

## v0.1.0

- Queue board for capture and human status (`ready`, `started`, `blocked`, `review`, `done`) inside Herdr, with peek, task page, project scope, done drawer, and undo.
