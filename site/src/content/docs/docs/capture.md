title: Capture
description: Add a task without leaving your work.
---

Press `+` or click **+ add**. Type a title, then press `Enter`.

## Quick-add

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Save and close |
| `Shift+Enter` | Save and add another |
| `Tab` | Open details |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

The board stays visible. A saved task flashes and becomes selected. Invalid input stays open with an explanation.

Clicking a task while the quick-add line is open discards the draft and selects that task.

## Details

Press `Tab` from quick-add to add notes, steps, a scope, or a thread. The draft uses the full pane and opens in Notes.

- `Shift+Enter` saves.
- `Esc` returns to the quick-add line.
- `Tab` from the line restores your draft details.

Scroll to reach steps below long notes. Typing brings the notes cursor back into view.

## Destination

| Where you add | Default destination |
| --- | --- |
| Project board | That project |
| Desk or Projects | The board's launch repository inside Git; desk outside Git |
| Herdr quick-capture popup | The focused pane's repository inside Git; desk outside Git |

Use title tokens or the draft's scope control to change the destination. Archived projects cannot receive new tasks.

Keeping an archived launch project archived changes the session's default to desk.

## Title tokens

Add a project or thread while typing the title:

```text
Fix login timeout !p atlas !t auth
Buy coffee !p
```

| Token | Destination or thread |
| --- | --- |
| `!p` | Desk |
| `!p name` | Project matching that basename, ignoring case |
| `!p /path` | Project at that path |
| `!t` | No thread |
| `!t name` | Named thread |

Each token takes one whitespace-separated argument. Put bare `!p` or `!t` at the end, or before another token. A following `#word` also leaves the token bare.

Tokens are removed from the saved title. Remaining words are joined with single spaces. A title is required.

A missing or ambiguous project name is kept as typed. Check spelling; use `tsk list --all --json` to find tasks filed under an unexpected project.

## Thread names

Thread names are lowercased and must:

- Start with an ASCII letter or digit.
- Contain only ASCII letters, digits, `-`, or `.`.
- Be at most 32 characters.

Invalid names leave the draft open with the rule that failed.

## Quick capture

In Herdr, press **prefix+a** after [setup](/docs/install/#add-to-herdr). A popup opens with Title focused.

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Type or edit the title | Name the task |
| Add notes, a thread, or steps | Include details before saving |
| `Shift+Enter` | Save and close the popup |
| `Esc` | Discard and close |

If a step editor or scope picker is open, `Esc` closes that first. During save recovery, it cancels the pending save.

Selected text from the invoking pane prefills the title. An archived launch project falls back to desk. A failed save keeps the draft open for retry or cancel.

You can also invoke the popup explicitly:

```sh
herdr plugin action invoke quick-capture --plugin herdr-tsk
```

For the same capture flow in your terminal, run `tsk capture`. `TSK_MODE=capture tsk` is equivalent.

## From an agent or script

```sh
tsk add -t "Fix login timeout" --thread auth
```
